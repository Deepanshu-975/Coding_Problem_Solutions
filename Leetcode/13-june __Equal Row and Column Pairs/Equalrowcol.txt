Brute force approch :
1. first take a row and comare it with every column value.
2. if it is eqaul then increase the count and print it.

Tc:o(n*n*n) =o(n^3)
sc: o(1);

Optimise approch :
1.  we create an unorderd map and push row element to it as a string and add #character to it.
with their frequencies.
2. Again we iterate over the map now check of column elements if column elments are present in mapp then update 
and as its frequencies.
3. at the end return the ans.

Tc:o(n^2)
sc:o(n)
